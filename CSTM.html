            <p class="text-black-50">
              The goal of this project was to access and share insights about the Canada Science and Technology Museum experience that emerged during our fieldwork
              with people on the autism spectrum and their support persons. To understand the experience of people with autism at the Museum, we observed five people
               with autism over two days onsite, four school children in grade six and one 35-year old man who used a wheelchair and had communication challenges.
               We also interviewed the man with autism and support persons including three teaching staff and a caregiver. We analyzed our interview and observation
               notes through a manual thematic analysis to formulate key findings and suggestions. These recommendations could be used by the Museum as it looks
               forward to improving the experience for people with autism. </p>

            <h2 class="text-black">Methods</h2>
            <p class="text-black-50">
              Our research consisted of two major phases: Collaboration and Background Research; and Observations and Interviews with People with Autism and Their Support Persons.
              </p>
              <h4 class="text-black">Phase One: Collaboration and Background Research</h4>
              <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/methodology.jpg" alt="">
              </div>
              <p class="text-black-50">
                Our first step was to expand our understanding in the field of creating accommodation for people with autism. To do this, we consulted with collaborators who helped us challenge our assumptions and
                consider different aspects of accessibility (see sidebar on page two), explored the CSTM’s website and spoke with CSTM staff to determine what
                accessibility features are already in place, and considered relevant literature.</p>
                <h5 class="text-black">List of Collaborators</h5>
                <p class="text-black-50">Our list of collaborators included: <b>CSTM Staff</b> who gave us a comprehensive tour of the site, including an overview of existing accessibility features, programming, and insights into areas that are still under development.
            <b>A parent of a child with autism</b> who advised us on the nature of the questions we planned to ask Museum visitors with autism and their support persons.
                <b>A counsellor for people with autism</b>, who is also the coordinator of a transition support centre for people with autism at a post-secondary institution, who advised us on accessibility solutions used at the transition support Centre.
                <b>A recreation therapist from a Children’s Treatment Centre</b> who discussed direct experiences of accessibility issues that children with autism face.</p>



<h4 class="text-black">Phase Two: Observations and Interviews with People with Autism and Their Support Persons</h4>
<p class="text-black-50">
  To understand the experience of people with autism at the CSTM, we observed five people with autism over two days onsite: four school children and one adult man. After the observation, we conducted interviews with three teaching staff, the man, and his caregiver. We were unable to interview the children because they had communication challenges, which prevented them from describing their experience in detail.

            <h2 class="text-black">Findings</h2>
            <p class="text-black-50">
              We identified recurring themes from the manual thematic coding of the interview transcripts and observation notes. Overall, 47 codes emerged from the
              interview transcripts, and these were further grouped into six categories. 58 codes emerged from the observation notes and these were again grouped
              into six categories. We used the number of instances, and number of people in whose interview or observation they occurred, to identify the categories
              that stood out (see side bars on pages four and five). This helped us identify the aspects of the Museum that worked well, the aspects that were
              acceptable but could be improved, and the aspects that were critical and needed attention. While we needed to be cautious to avoid drawing strong
              conclusions from our small sample size, we could syncretize across our academic, professional, personal, and lived experience resources, to
              formulate the findings discussed below.
              </p>

              <h4 class="text-black">Interviews</h4>

                <p class="text-black-50">Overwhelmingly, <b>Resources</b> was the most prevalent category. Participants commonly reported resources that work for them at
                  other community spaces, and gave suggestions for improving resources at the Museum. Commonly desired resources were: low sensory spaces,
                  clearer signage, preparation materials on the website, and transportation assistance. </p>
                  <p class="text-black-50">Visitors <b>liked</b> a variety of aspects, but overall preferred aspects that were the most engaging to them.</p>
                  <p class="text-black-50">Participants referenced <b>overstimulation</b> and suggested that there be low sensory days or hours. They commented on general busyness through the number of other visitors.</p>
                    <p class="text-black-50">We noted a need for a variety of <b>developmental levels</b> to be offered in each of the exhibits.</p>
                    <p class="text-black-50">The CSTM is a highly accessible Museum, so it was no surprise that <b>physical accessibility</b> was the least prevalent category. Still, there were some instances when a participant who uses a wheelchair could not access exhibits.</p>

                      <img class="img-fluid" src="img/CSTM02.jpg" alt="">

                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-black">Observation</h4>
                    <p class="text-black-50">
                      Observation results mirrored much of the results from the interviews. The overlapping categories with the interviews were <b>Likes</b>, <b>Other visitors</b>,
                      and <b>Physical accessibility</b>. The category that stood out the most in the observation was <b>Engagement</b>, a category that encompassed any engaged
                      interaction with a specific exhibit by our Museum visitors. The prevalence of this category and the Likes category reflects positively on the
                      experience provided by the current exhibits at the Museum. While the <b>support person</b> was a code under the category of Resources in the interviews,
                      they were more prominent in the observations, emphasizing that providing resources for support persons could be an important measure.</p>
                      <p class="text-black-50">Similar to the interviews, <b>exhibit effectiveness</b> stood out in the observations. Likes was a prevalent category in both the interviews and observations, greatly
                      outweighing the prevalence of the Dislikes category. A common trend was that participants enjoyed exhibits
                      </p>

    <h2 class="text-black">Suggestions</h2>
    <p class="text-black-50">
      In addition to the very positive feedback, some common themes that emerged throughout the interviews and observations provided us with insight that led to the
      following suggestions to improve the Museum’s accessibility for people with autism.</p>
      <h4 class="text-black">Create Interactive Exhibits for a Variety of Developmental Levels</h4>
      <p class="text-black-50">
        The number one indicator for an exhibit being liked was that it was interactive. To ensure that the exhibits are engaging to all audiences, it would be
        beneficial if there were an inclusion of interactive features at a variety of developmental levels in all exhibits.  </p>
        <h4 class="text-black">Enhance Options for Reducing Sensory Stimulation</h4>
          <p class="text-black-50"><b>Incorporating more low-sensory spaces throughout the Museum</b>: We accessed the low sensory classroom for our participants by request. While other visitors
          can request it as well, not everyone interviewed realized such room was available. The support persons told us that quiet spaces throughout the Museum would
          be helpful since the Museum is large and there is no way to get to the classroom space without walking through many high sensory exhibits.</p>
          <p class="text-black-50"><b>Providing sensory processing tools</b>, such as weighted blankets, noise cancelling headphones, earplugs, communication
            headphones so that individuals can be addressed directly, or shaded glasses could be provided for visitors to borrow.</p>
          <p class="text-black-50">Informing visitors of high-traffic times. A note on the website, or reminders on social media could inform visitors about busy
            mornings during the week due to school visits.</p>
            <h4 class="text-black">Improve Navigation Resources</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50">
              Participants often commented on the confusing layout of the Museum. To improve this, the Museum is currently working on sensory maps and are planning more
              work on the Museum’s wayfinding system. In addition, we suggest: <b>Developmentally appropriate maps</b>, paired with better signage throughout. Ideally, the signage would be able to be followed tactually and visually.
              <b>Signage</b> that includes information about the sensory characteristics of each area to aid people in choosing exhibits that work best for them. <b>Information about exhibits</b> that would enhance the pre-planning of visits, through the website and <b>Wayfinding apps</b>.
